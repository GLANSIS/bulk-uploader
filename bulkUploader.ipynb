You only need to run it the first time you run this script. After that, the packages will be installed in your system. For that reason, I have the code commented out because there should be no reason to run any other time. IF this is your first time, remove the '#' to uncomment the second line ('pip install requirement.text'). Make sure the requirements.txt is in the main folder.\n",
